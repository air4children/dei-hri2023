\begin{frame}{Statistical analysis}

\begin{itemize}
\item A Wilcoxon T test was used to analyze the results of the survey before and after the survey to see if the engineering attitudes had a significant effect on pre and post survey of the workshop.
\item The average survey before the test was lower ($\mu$ = 2.194500 $\pm \sigma$ 0.558367 ) compared to the posttest results ($\mu$ = 2.239500 $\pm \sigma$= 0.396796).
\item There was no statistically significant in the increase of attitudes towards engineering (t=53.5, p= 0.45).
\end{itemize}
