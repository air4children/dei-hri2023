Instruments
The interview protocol invited teachers to share internal and
external factors that might facilitate and/or inhibit the implementation
of inclusive teaching practices. The interview was conducted before
and after the intervention period. A validated classroom observation
protocol was administered weekly to capture how teachers utilized
technology to deliver instruction, differentiation, and create an
inclusive learning environment [16].

### Minutes 
Disucssiong about the air4children project and its vision. Also touched on the potential collaborations for protocols of surveys, and curriculum desing. 
For future meetings, it would be great to have: 
* Prepare a draft for the study design
* Engage with other researchers to draft a paper.
