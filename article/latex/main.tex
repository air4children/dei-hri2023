\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we present a pilot study aiming to investigate the challenges of teaching AI and Robotics to children in a Mexican town.
Challenges such as teaching bias in AI and inclusive learning with Montessori method were introduced, emphasising the contextual background in Mexico.
For the pilot study, we invited 14 participants of which 10 were able to attend, 6 male and 4 female of (age in years: mean=8 and std=$\pm$1.61) and four instructors of different teaching experiences and skills to young audiences.
We reported results of four-lesson curriculum of teaching AI and Robotics in a community where little to none experts were able to taught such subjects, and the challenges of creating a curriculum that is both inclusive and engaging with Montessori method and low-cost open source robots. 
We concluded that this pilot study helped participants to understand fundamental concepts of AI and Robotics and provided better understanding on financial and logistical challenges to organise a workshop with a major number of participants as potential future work.

\section{Introduction}
Teaching Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotics to young learners has been made good progress in the last decade \cite{bers2019, druga2019}.
Educational progress has been possible due to the great investment in AI and Robotics in countries such as U.S.A, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden, making those countries and their communities to define core values in AI and Robotics \cite{druga2019}. These raise the question on 
how to adapt such core values from the most to the least privileged environments~\cite{pratyusha2020}. 
For instance, it has been little progress on using open-source  educational robots and the creation of child-centred programs to teach AI and Robotics in low-income countries ~\cite{abadilloperez2022_DEI_HRI2022, montenegro2021air4children}.
However, there are various challenges on teaching AI and Robotics to young learners such as the barrier of teaching programming skills to those who are still learning writing and reading skills to which visual and auditory programs using sensor, action and logic blocks helped to address such challenges \cite{long2020, wyeth2008}.
Other challenge is the little to none experts to teach AI and Robotics and its limited educational material in low-income countries~\cite{yang2022, abadilloperez2022_DEI_HRI2022}.
% Even though open-source educational robots seems to be affordable, there seems to be
% Current research lines in AI and Robotics claims to be neutral where data pipelines align with principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR). %TOADD_REF
There is also emerging values in the field of ML/AI on societal forces questioning what research is done and who benefits~\cite{birhane2022}. 
Hence, the aim of this work is to
investigate further challenges of teaching AI and Robotics to young audiences in a Mexican town where little no experts can teach such subjects with limited resources.

%% Here to add a brieft description of the sections of the paper 
In this paper, we present challenges of teaching AI and Robotics to Children in a Mexican town, including study design and curriculum design and results and surveys from a pilot experiment of four lessons and conclusions and future work.

\section{Challenges of teaching AI and Robotics to Children}
\subsection{Teaching bias in AI}
Smith et al. pointed out the current challenges of when and how to teach computing ethics to students~\cite{smith2022incorporating}.
Learning ethics in introductory courses help students to think ethically about their computation topics~\cite{fiesler2021}.
% TOREVIEW \cite{weerts2022}
Payne et al. have shown great progress on making pilots and beta test teaching ethical AI to young audiences~\cite{payne2020}.
For instance, on summer 2021 a pilot to teach ethical AI to young audiences were organised with 28 kids at the Media Lab with a cost of \$150 for the week, leading to a beta test with 250 students in autumn 2021. Such pilots considered question related to the everyday life of children, such as 
"What's is the best algorithm to make a peanut-butter sandwich?: is it the algorithm that makes the tastiest sandwich? , is it the prettiest sandwich?, is it the quickest and easiest to make? or the easiest to clean up?". Hence the challenge is how to contextualise such questions in Mexican town where children may know little to know about AI and Robotics or terminology in ethics (bias).

\subsection{Inclusive learning of AI and Robotics with Montessori method}
Montessori method is focused in child-centred development where the role of Montessori teachers is to help children individually or in small groups engaging in self-directed activities \cite{Aljabreen2020}.
The adoption of technological topics (AI and Robotics) into Montessori methods has been experimented and studied in the last 10 years \cite{elkin2014}. 
However, there are other skills that are also required to create inclusive learning of new technologies. For example, "collaborative skills" and "understating concepts" are two main factors to design inclusive AI literary for children in low, medium and high socioeconomic backgrounds \cite{druga2019}. 
Also, there is evidence on the impact of collaboration and engagement activities on how coding games and robots to enhance computational thinking \cite{sharma2019}.
Hence, the challenge is how to adapt Montessori method to not only create conditions to develop physical and social requirements but collaborative and literacy skills through hands-on activities. 

\section{Pilot study: study design and curriculum design}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Brieft introduction to this section [MX/TB]
\subsection{Participants}
In this pilot study, we invited 14 participants between the age of 6 to 9 years old. During the pilot workshop, only 10 participants 6 male and 4 female of (age in years: mean=8 and std=$\pm$1.61) were able to join the workshops as remained ones 
  were unable to attend due to personal circumstances. We also invited four instructors with different years of experience in teaching subjects to young audiences and one person to lead the logistics of the event. 

\subsection{Lessons}
Aiming to create inclusive teaching practices for students, we considered a study design based on procedures, instruments,  data collection and analysis~\cite{du2022}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% TON~O and DONATO will draft details of the lessons in four paragraphs (or one large paragraph) 
For instance, Figure~\ref{fig:curriculum} illustrates the curriculum design for the pilot experiment. 
In lesson 01, we introduced basics concept of human senses and how artificial intelligence relates to identifying cats and dogs. We were able to use more dynamic activities with protoboards and simple electric circuits so that children can easily learn fundamentals on how a robot works (Figure~\ref{fig:main}d). 
In lesson 02, we presented examples on how artificial intelligence learn to recognize animals or humans with a tangram activity and gave them a mini introduction to the code that they will use for the robot.
In lesson 03, we adopted a bingo game with key terms from the previous lessons (Figure~\ref{fig:main}b). We 
introduced what is algorithm with an activity of cooking quesadillas where students learnt that everyone can have a different answer given the same instruction.
We also organised activities on action/reaction with different sensors, how sensors work, how to program sensors and examples with the protoboards and circuits.
In lesson 04, we closed the course, starting with an activity in the garden where students program their teammates and practice to give instructions to a robot in order to get the wanted result. Then we show them some real life applications of AI and robotics and we grouped participants in three teams so they could program their robots and design their logo (Figure~\ref{fig:main}e).

\section{Results}
% \subsection{Pilot study}
Four lessons of the curriculum were organised on Mondays and Wednesdays in two weeks of November 2022. 
Instructors helped children in the pilot workshop by creating groups of three to four children.
In the final lesson groups presented their project with their own robot and children with the help of the instructor explained the application of the robot.

In this paper, we investigated the challenges of teaching AI and Robotics to young audiences with a pilot study in a Mexican town. We concluded that Parents and children have the willingness to join this pilot study by participating and learning new experiences on collaborative and fun activities with low-cost educational robots. However, limited self-funded budget restricted us to prepare and  organised a major number of lessons and reach more participants which hopefully will be addressed in future work.
