\section{Introduction}
Teaching Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotics to young learners has been made good progress in the last decade~\cite{bers2019, druga2019}.
Educational progress has been possible due to the great investment in AI and Robotics in countries such as U.S.A, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden, making those countries and their communities to define core values in AI and Robotics~\cite{druga2019}. 
These raise the question on how to adapt such core values from the most to the least privileged environments~\cite{pratyusha2020}. 
Recently, it has been few progress on using open-source  educational robots and the creation of child-centred programs to teach AI and Robotics in low- and middle-income countries~\cite{abadilloperez2022_DEI_HRI2022, montenegro2021air4children}.
However, there are various challenges on teaching AI and Robotics to young learners.
For instance, the barrier of teaching programming skills to those who are still learning writing and reading skills to which visual and auditory programs using sensor, action and logic blocks helped to address such challenges~\cite{long2020, wyeth2008}.
Other challenge is the little to none experts to teach AI and Robotics and its limited educational material in low- and middle-income countries~\cite{yang2022, abadilloperez2022_DEI_HRI2022}.
% Even though open-source educational robots seems to be affordable, there seems to be
% Current research lines in AI and Robotics claims to be neutral where data pipelines align with principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR). %TOADD_REF
Hence, the aim of this work is to investigate further challenges of teaching AI and Robotics to young audiences in a Mexican town where little no experts can teach such subjects with limited resources.

%% Here to add a brieft description of the sections of the paper

\section{Challenges of teaching AI and Robotics to Children}
\subsection{Teaching bias in AI}
Smith et al. pointed out the current challenges of when and how to teach computing ethics to students~\cite{smith2022incorporating}.
Learning ethics in introductory courses help students to think ethically about their computation topics~\cite{fiesler2021}.
% TOREVIEW \cite{weerts2022}
Payne et al. have shown great progress on making pilots and beta test teaching ethical AI to young audiences~\cite{payne2020}.
For instance, on summer 2021 a pilot to teach ethical AI to young audiences were organised with 28 kids at the Media Lab with a cost of \$150 for the week, leading to a beta test with 250 students in autumn 2021. 
Such pilots considered question related to the everyday life of children, such as "What's is the best algorithm to make a peanut-butter sandwich?: is it the algorithm that makes the tastiest sandwich? , is it the prettiest sandwich?, is it the quickest and easiest to make? or the easiest to clean up?". 
Hence the challenge is to contextualise such questions in a Mexican town where children may know little to none about AI, Robotics end ethics (bias).

\subsection{Inclusive learning of AI and Robotics with Montessori method}
Montessori method is focused in child-centred development where the role of Montessori teachers is to help children individually or in small groups engaging in self-directed activities \cite{Aljabreen2020}.
The adoption of technological topics (AI and Robotics) into Montessori methods has been experimented and studied in the last 10 years \cite{elkin2014}. 
However, there are other skills that are also required to create inclusive learning of new technologies. For example, "collaborative skills" and "understating concepts" are two main factors to design inclusive AI literary for children in low, medium and high socioeconomic backgrounds \cite{druga2019}. 
Also, there is evidence on the impact of collaboration and engagement activities on how coding games and robots to enhance computational thinking \cite{sharma2019}.
Hence, the challenge is how to adapt Montessori method to not only create conditions to develop physical and social requirements but collaborative and literacy skills through hands-on activities.

\section{Pilot study: study design and curriculum design}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Brieft introduction to this section [MX/TB]
\subsection{Participants}
In this pilot study, we invited 14 participants between the age of 6 to 9 years old. 
During the pilot workshop, only 10 participants 6 male and 4 female of (age in years: mean=8 and std=$\pm$1.61) were able to join the workshops as remained ones were unable to attend due to personal circumstances. 
We also invited four instructors with various experiences levels in teaching subjects to young audiences (two between 5 to 10 years and two with less than 2 years) and one person to lead the logistics of the event.

\subsection{Lessons}
Aiming to create inclusive teaching practices for students, we considered a study design based on procedures, instruments,  data collection and analysis~\cite{du2022}.
Considering the limited human and material resources, we decided to teach four lessons instead of the original ten lessons for the pilot study of this curriculum.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% TON~O and DONATO will draft details of the lessons in four paragraphs (or one large paragraph) 
Figure~\ref{fig:curriculum} illustrates the curriculum design for the pilot experiment. 
During the first lesson, we introduced basics concept of human senses and how AI relates to identifying cats and dogs. We were able to use more dynamic activities with protoboards and simple electric circuits so that children can easily learn fundamentals on how a robot works (Figure~\ref{fig:main}d). 
For the second lesson, we presented examples on how AI learn to recognize animals or humans with a tangram activity and gave them a mini introduction to the code that they will use for the robot.
In the third lesson, we adopted a bingo game with key terms from the previous lessons (Figure~\ref{fig:main}b). We 
introduced what is algorithm with an activity of cooking quesadillas where students learnt that everyone can have a different answer given the same instruction.
We also organised activities on action/reaction with different sensors, how sensors work, how to program sensors and examples with the protoboards and circuits.
During the fourth lesson, we closed the course, starting with an activity in the garden where students program their teammates and practice to give instructions to a robot in order to get the wanted result. Then we show them some real life applications of AI and robotics and we grouped participants in three teams so they could program their robots and design their logo (Figure~\ref{fig:main}e). 

\subsection{Surveys}
Considering "Engineering Attitudes Survey" \cite{cunningham2010impact}, we surveyed all participants with same survey, one for the first lesson and one for the last day of the lessons. 
Considering the reduction of time, fatigue and financial compensation, we consider a three-scale Likert chart \cite{jebb2021}, where each statement in our survey has three numbers where 1 is totally disagree; 2: not sure, and 3 totally agree .
See original statements in Table~\ref{tab:questions} and Spanish translation of the statements in Fig~\ref{fig:survey}.

To analyse the results of the survey, we consider the percentages of the responses of each statement from the first and the last lesson and illustrate the results using percentage response of Likert scale charts.
Considering the small sample of participants and the no assumptions to data distributions, we choose the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test for statistical analysis for answers of pretest and posttest survey \cite{scipy2001}.

% https://www.statstutor.ac.uk/resources/uploaded/mannwhitney.pdf
% The Mann-Whitney U test is a non-parametric test that can be used in place of an
% unpaired t-test. It is used to test the null hypothesis that two samples come from the
% same population (i.e. have the same median) or, alternatively, whether observations in one
% sample tend to be larger than observations in the other. Although it is a non-parametric
% test it does assume that the two distributions are similar in shape.

% A proposal for the statistical analysis of the surveys is as follows.
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Select our sample, that is, the people who will answer our surveys. 
%     %(OUR SAMPLE WILL BE ALL THE CHILDREN INVITED TO THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COURSE) 
%     In order to make a representative sample that shows the majority of our student's opinions, it is necessary to define three important points:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Size of our population. 
%         %14 children
%         \item Margin of error (percentage that defines how much the results are close to the opinion of the whole group we are studying).
%         %14.28\% obtenida del numero de estudiantes que teníamos y cuántos lograron hacer los cuestionarios
%         \item Our confidence level (the percentage you think you will be right about which answer our population will select).
%          %90\% that most of the children's answers will change after the class. 
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item Calculate the surveys needed to obtain representative responses from the students with Eq.~\ref{eq:survey}.
%     \begin{equation}
%     \label{eq:survey}
%        n = \frac{N}{[0.05^2 x (N-1)+1]}
%     \end{equation}
%     where, $n=$ number of samples, $N=$ population size and $x=$ number of surveys needed.
%     \item Verify how many surveys were fully completed.
%     \item Given the number of surveys needed and the actual surveys completely made, conclude if the data is reliable and representative.
% \end{enumerate}

\section{Results}
% \subsection{Pilot study}
Four lessons of the designed curriculum were organised on Mondays and Wednesdays in a Mexican town during two weeks of November 2022. 
Instructors helped children in the pilot workshop by creating groups of three to four children.
In the final lesson groups presented their project with their own robot and children with the help of the instructor explained the application of the robot (Figure~\ref{fig:main}).

We only considered 9 participants for the survey as 5 participants were neither in one of the days of the surveys or there were not able to be in person in such days. 
Figure~\ref{fig:results} illustrates percentages or responses of 20 statements from 9 participants for 1 which is totally disagree; 2: not sure, and 3 totally agree.
It can be noted that "S3: I would like a job where I could invent things.", "S11: I would like a job that lets me figure it out how things work"
and ", and "S18: Engineers help make people’s lives better." showed an increase of agreement. 
Whereas "S6: I would like to build and test machines that could help people to walk." and  "S8: I would enjoy a job helping to protect the environment." created less disagreement.
"S17: Scientist help make people’s lives better." resulted in the highest average value whereas "S16: Engineers cause problems in the world." is the lowest average value.
"S19: I think I know what scientists do for their jobs." and "S20: I think I know what engineers do for their jobs." showed both an increase on agreement between participants and decrease in disagreement.

A Wilcoxon T test was used to analyze the results of the survey before and after the survey to see if the engineering attitudes had a significant effect on pre and post survey of the workshop.
The average survey before the test was lower ($\mu$ = 2.194500 $\pm \sigma$ 0.558367 ) compared to the posttest results ($\mu$ = 2.239500 $\pm \sigma$= 0.396796).
There was no statistically significant in the increase of attitudes towards engineering (t=53.5, p= 0.45).
See Appendix section for reproducible Jupyter notebooks of statistical analysis and plots.

\section{Conclusions and future work}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% CONCLUSIONS
%%% Please add any conclusions that you saw during the pilot
In this paper, we investigated the challenges of teaching AI and Robotics to young audiences with a pilot study in a Mexican town.
We designed ten lessons but only were able to pilot four lessons due the limited material and human resources. 
We also surveyed participants using Engineering Attitudes Survey from \cite{cunningham2010impact}, and showed the impact on the increase of general agreement of understanding what engineers and scientist do in their jobs using Likert scale charts.
However, statistical analysis suggested no statistically significant in the increase of attitudes towards
engineering  which we think is related to our small sample. 
Also, during the survey we noted that children were not able to read long sentences and were confused about agreement and disagreement terminology in the Likert scale.

We conclude that children and parents had the willingness to join this pilot study by learning new experiences on collaborative and fun activities
based on Montessori education and with low-cost educational robots. 
We also conclude that to be inclusive we would like to include anyone from a potential generation that might be ruled by AI. 
Hence, thanks to these activities we allowed these children coming from low- to mid-income families to learn and be aware of the potential of AI which is crucial in this technological world.

However, the limited and self-funded budget for this project restricted us to prepare and organise a major number of lessons and reach more participants which hopefully will be addressed in future work. 
We will also improve our pretest-posttest survey design with a reliable and representative data and its statistical analysis.
