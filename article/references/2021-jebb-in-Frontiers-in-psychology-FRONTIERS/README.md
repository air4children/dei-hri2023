## Notes

"Maximizing Validity in Short Forms Using Ant Colony Optimization
Increasingly, psychologists wish to use short scales in their work (Leite et al., 2008),6 as they reduce respondent time, fatigue, and required financial compensation. To date, the most common approaches aim to maintain reliability (Leite et al., 2008; Kruyen et al., 2013) and include retaining items with the highest factor loadings and item-total correlations. However, these strategies can incidentally impair measurement (Janssen et al., 2015; Olaru et al., 2015; Schroeders et al., 2016), as items with higher intercorrelations will usually have more similar content, resulting in less scale content (i.e., the attenuation paradox; Loevinger, 1954)."

ABSTRACT={Developing self-report Likert scales is an essential part of modern psychology. However, it is hard for psychologists to remain apprised of best practices as methodological developments accumulate. To address this, this current paper offers a selective review of advances in Likert scale development that have occurred over the past 25 years. We reviewed six major measurement journals (e.g., Psychological Methods, Educational, and Psychological Measurement) between the years 1995–2019 and identified key advances, ultimately including 40 papers and offering written summaries of each. We supplemented this review with an in-depth discussion of five particular advances: (1) conceptions of construct validity, (2) creating better construct definitions, (3) readability tests for generating items, (4) alternative measures of precision [e.g., coefficient omega and item response theory (IRT) information], and (5) ant colony optimization (ACO) for creating short forms. The <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Material</xref> provides further technical details on these advances and offers guidance on software implementation. This paper is intended to be a resource for psychological researchers to be informed about more recent psychometric progress in Likert scale creation.}
