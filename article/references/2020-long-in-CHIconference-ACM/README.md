## Notes

"Research indicates that children first personify agents and
then recognize that they are programmable [47,69,80]. This
recognition is foundational for understanding how AI works
(Competency 17 (Programmability)), and providing
opportunities for learners of all ages to program AI can foster
this understanding (Design Consideration 6 (Opportunities
to Program). Several recent projects such as Cognimates
[44], eCraft2Learn [151], and others [4,146,149] enable
young learners to program AI. However, it is important for
designers to keep in mind that prerequisite coding skills can
be a barrier to entry, especially for children who are still
learning how to read [43,69]. Visual and auditory elements
[43], fill-in-the-blank code [69], and Parsons problems [53]
are some techniques that can reduce this barrier.

Building on prior knowledge and interests can also
contribute to engaging learning experiences [19]. Research
in CS and AI education has shown that leveraging learners’
interests in areas like music [91], games [37,96,136,147], or
sports [146] can encourage learning, particularly in
underrepresented groups (Design Consideration 12
(Leverage Learners’ Interests)). Recent research is
investigating children’s interests in AI. When asked to
imagine future AI, kids drew robots, animals, and “things
that can play games” [43]. Many wanted AI to do things for
them that they did not want to do (e.g. chores). Other desired
abilities included conversing and school tasks [43].
