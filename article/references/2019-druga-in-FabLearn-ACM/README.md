abstract = {We observed how 102 children (7-12 years old), from four different countries (U.S.A, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden), imagine smart devices and toys of the future and how they perceive current AI technologies. Children outside of U.S.A were overall more critical of these technologies and less exposed to them. The way children collaborated and communicated while describing their AI perception and expectations were influenced both by their social-economical and cultural background. Children in low and medium SES schools and centers were better are collaborating compared to high SES children, but had a harder time advancing because they had less experience with coding and interacting with these technologies. Children in high SES schools and centers had troubles collaborating initially but displayed a stronger understanding of AI concepts. Based on our initial findings we propose a series of guidelines for designing future hands-on learning activities with smart toys and AI devices for K8 students.},
